	<h2>Who am I?</h2>
	<p><span class="alinea">Yo guys! I'm YoshiGamerFR, a french guy.</span><br>Also a very famous youtuber (completely true no fake fr) known as YoshiGamerFR on my french channel, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@YoshiGamerTheReal">YoshiGamerTheReal</a> on my secondary channel (the English one). I make games on GameJolt and itch.io, and I will link them on this website, and I will also link their GameJolt/itch.io pages.</p>

	<h2>My games</h2>
	<br>
	<h3><a href="platformer-dark.html">Platformer</a></h3>
	<p>This was my favorite game to make, also the first one I posted online. I made a YouTube Short and a TikTok on it (unfortunately it was in French).</p>
	<br>
	<h3><a href="wfc-dark.html">Waluigi's Fried Chicken</a></h3>
	<p>Now this game... It's a joke game. I did it because why not? Joke games are fun. WFC is filled up with memes, fun to play, trust me. Go check it out.</p>
