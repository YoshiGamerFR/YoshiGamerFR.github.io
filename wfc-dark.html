	<h1>What is <i>Waluigi's Fried Chicken</i>? (WFC)</h1>
	<br><br><img src="images/wfc.png" alt="Waluigi's Fried Chicken thumbnail, as shown on it's GameJolt and itch.io pages." height="240" width="427" style="float: right;"><br><br>
	<p><i>WFC</i> is a joke game I made because joke games are funny. WFC is a really goofy game, if you want to play my games, I recommend starting of with this one for sure! WFC is filled with memes and other things, without it being too much. WFC was also a kind of tribute to one of my project I had to abandon, because at the time, it was too difficult for me to make, I still don't have the ressources to make it. I originally wanted to make a game called <i>Five Nights at Waluigi's</i>, because I didn't know about <i><a href="https://gamejolt.com/games/five-nights-at-wario-s/44054" target="blank">Five Nights at Wario's</a></i>, it would have been going to be a series of games called FNaW, yeah... Just like <i>Five Nights at Wario's</i>...</p><br><br>
